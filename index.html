     <h2>Horses are still for sale...<br> 
        But what if I said Horse Game 2?</h2>

    <h3>Exotic breeds are still available below...<br> But please don't ask where. If you know, you know!</h3>

    <p>What the folks at here have done for me and my family is amazing. When my car broke down
        and became too expensive to upkeep, the gentleman in charge of this establishment gave me my very own
        purebred stallion! Yeah, my new Arabian Equus callabus has an attitude, practically owns me, abuses me,
        is unrideable, untamable, and beastly in every sense of the word, I just love him to death! - Ted, The Loyalest Customer
