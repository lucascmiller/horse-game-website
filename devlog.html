<h1>Dev Log</h1>

<h2 class="ourstory">Horse Game was a game made by Gravestron, who made it using Clickteam Fusion. 
    The game was janky to say the least, having plenty of issues, including how little it holds your hands.
    But just because the game wasn't flawless doesn't mean it wasn't amazing! The game had a really fun artsytle,
    a really good soundtrack, and a world with intresting things to explore and interact with.
